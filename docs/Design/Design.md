- Git Branching style for data

  - Duplicate Board works immeditely, because it's git branch of same data. Not need to copy hundreds of cards slowly one card a time.
- Retro Modern Future
  - All browsers with same code. No feature detection. If browser adds new features, they work in that browser.
  - Retro
    - HTML4 that works at Amiga IBrowse, Netsurf, Lynx, etc
    - At AmigaOS/AROS/MorphOS at 680x0/PPC/x86 uses FreePascal compiled at Amiga, SQLite database, IBrowse webbrowser or other available webbrowser
    - No drag drop, so showing checkboxes and buttons for moving etc
    - No SVG or VML, so uses ASCII graphics for drawing lines between cards
    - At IE6, uses VML vector graphics for drawing lines between cards
    - No idea how to support Netscape or IE3, because they do not support submit form buttons
  - Modern features, when browser supports it
    - Rounded corners with CSS
    - Drag drop
    - Do not use fake rounded corners with transparent corner GIF, because it would require GIF image for every color
    - There will be custom color selection from color wheel for font and background color. Or trying to calculate colors that are visible enough.
  - Future, when browser and device supports it
    - Touch drag multiple cards at once with many fingers using https://interactjs.io . This is WeKan innovation, no other kanban has it yet.
- No migrations
  - Use directly any existing database structure, with general card convert proxy:
    - WeKan any old and new version structure MongoDB 3, 6, 8 etc
    - Kanboard
    - Trello. Newest Trello has new design:
      - Email Inbox
      - New board button position at top, copied from [original WeKan feature from 2018-09-28]( https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v1511-2018-09-28-wekan-edge-release)
      - Mirror Card, copied from [original WeKan feature Linked Cards from 2018-04-18](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/pull/1592), discussed at [WeKan issue 5683](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/5683)
      - Map Card, copied from [original WeKan feature request from  2017-01-06](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/755)
    - Jira. Newest Jira at 2025-06-29 has UI design copied from ClickUp, where is left sidebar menu.
    - ClickUp
    - etc
  - Detects what database is used
  - Detects database structure
  - Detects OpenAPI structure
