    - Accessibility
  - Many more
    - https://github.com/wekan/wekan/blob/main/docs/DeveloperDocs/WeKan-Multiverse-Roadmap.md

### Anybrowser-style, designed for WeKan development

- To be accessible to any user, pages need to be visible at any browser
  - This is working already with code at https://github.com/wekan/wami/blob/main/wekan.pas
- Designed for iffy Internet
  - with minimal amount of browserside code
  - https://github.com/howinfo/howinfo/wiki/Design#should-we-design-for-iffy-internet

### Progressive enhancement

  - https://www.w3.org/wiki/Graceful_degradation_versus_progressive_enhancement
  - No browser detection by user agent etc. All code for all browsers included.
  - Design first for all browsers, having all features available there.
    - This requires using http://aminet.net style HTML4
  - Images and icons with GIF images, that are visible at any browser
  - Works without Javascript
  - Additional features where browser supports it:
    - CSS Rounded Corners
      - not using fake transparent GIF edges, because it would require separate GIF image for each color
        - [2025-06-19](https://github.com/wekan/wami/commit/60a6d583#diff-55eb6b0b766ec41c008ef615b2f1d3e24ba16b8c8ba549a84c5e73e2ab54344bR15-R17) and [2025-06-20](https://github.com/wekan/wami/commit/31ba33b37ab4b867fd2e344bf5ad004085745cb4)
      - [Original WeKan feature from 2022-02-06](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/4326)
    - Drag drop of Swimlanes/Lists/Cards/Checklists
    - If browser does not support Javascript, moving cards by checkbox selecting them, pressing Move Submit button
    - If device has touch screen, there is touch drag drop
    - If device supports multitouch drag and browser supports multidrag, drag many cards at once with https://interactjs.io . This is original WeKan feature.
  - Vector graphics for drawing between cards, drawing line draws with all of these all the time:
    - Amiga IBrowse: ASCII Art
    - IE6: VML
    - Netsurf/Chromium/etc: SVG

### Not supported browsers

- Netscape, IE3
- Because no form submit button feature

### Supported browsers

- Maintained browsers
  - IBrowse https://www.ibrowse-dev.net for AmigaOSÂ® 3.0, 3.1, 3.1.4, 3.2, 3.5, 3.9, 4.1FE and MorphOS
  - Dillo for FreeDOS, Linux, BSD, MacOS, Windows (via Cygwin or WSL), Atari.
  - Text browsers: Links, ELinks, w3m, Chawan
  - Modern browsers based on: Ladybird, Safari, Chromium, Firefox, Webkit, Servo
- Legacy browsers based on browser engines from Microsoft
  - EdgeHTML like Legacy Edge (that was after IE, and before Credge/Chromium Edge)

### Accessibility

- [PRs welcome](MakingPullRequest.md) for accessibility improvements at https://github.com/wekan/wami/pulls
  - Accessibility related comments are at code at https://github.com/wekan/wami/blob/main/wekan.pas
  - Before sending PR, required is to test with all above mentioned supported browsers, that pages are visible and all features work.
- To be accessible to any user, pages need to be visible at any browser. Wami has Anybrowser, Meteor 2 does not have.
- Accessibility links at https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/459
- Use only one table. No nested tables, those do not work with screen readers. Do not use merged of split cells.
- Semantic HTML https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics
- There will be custom color selection from color wheel for font and background color. Or trying to calculate colors that are visible enough.
- Tab order that works for screenreaders and keyboard navigation
- Every webpage is tested with accessibility browser extensions
- Correctly visible colors

### Minimap

- Add minimap, like at some games there is.
- This is original Wami feature, no other kanban has minimap.
- So visible part of WeKan kanban board is loaded immediately, with minimal amount of browserside code.
- From minimap it's possible to move to other parts of board.
- If there is Javascript support, load only visible part of board, and when scrolling, load more cards when that part of board becomes visible.

### Example Supported HTML4 code

<pre>
// Example: Add(BoardIcon('At touchscreen', 1, 'white', 'blue'));
function BoardIcon(BoardTitle: String; TabIndex: Integer; Color: String; BackgroundColor: String): String;
begin
  Result := '<table bgcolor="' + BackgroundColor + '" tabindex="' + IntToStr(TabIndex) + '" style="border-collapse: collapse;" width="200"' +
            ' height="80" border="0" padding="0" spacing="0" id="drag-' + IntToStr(TabIndex) + '" class="draggable" border-collapse="collapse">' + LineEnding +
          '  <tbody>' + LineEnding +
          '    <tr border="0" padding="0" spacing="0">' + LineEnding +
          '      <td width="20" height="20"></td>' + LineEnding +
          '      <td width="160" height="40" valign="middle" align="top"><font size="1" color="' + Color + '" face="arial"><b>' + BoardTitle + '</b><p></p></font></td>' + LineEnding +
          '      <td width="20" height="20"></td>' + LineEnding +
          '    </tr>' + LineEnding +
          '    <tr border="0" padding="0" spacing="0">' + LineEnding +
          '      <td width="20" height="20"></td>' + LineEnding +
          '      <td width="160" height="20"></td>' + LineEnding +
          '      <td width="20" height="20"></td>' + LineEnding +
          '    </tr>' + LineEnding +
          '    <tr border="0" padding="0" spacing="0">' + LineEnding +
          '      <td width="20" height="20"></td>' + LineEnding +
          '      <td width="160" height="20"></td>' + LineEnding +
          '      <td width="20" height="20"></td>' + LineEnding +
          '    </tr>' + LineEnding +
          '  </tbody>' + LineEnding +
          '</table>' + LineEnding +
          '<br>' + LineEnding;
end;
<pre>

### HTML4 tags to use first, to make visible at all browsers

- Use only one table. No nested tables, no merged cells, no split cells.
- table tbody tr td
- &lt;font size="4" face="arial" color="#000000" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"&rt;Text&lt;/font&rt;
- border="0"
- tabindex="1"
- height="80" width="20"
- padding="0"
- spacing="0"
- id="SomeID"
- height="20"
- HTML form elements, like checklists, submit buttons
- There is upload example at wekan.pas

### These only work at modern browsers, so use only if it looks similar with above HTML4 tags
